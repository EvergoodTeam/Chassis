Creating hundreds of Json files for some Blocks is REALLY time-consuming, so you should automate that

Chassis is a Library providing utilities for dynamic asset generation (Blockstates, Models, Tags, Recipes, Loot Tables,
Textures) and simple configuration.

A showcase of the available features can be found (commented) in the source code or
in [Compressor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compressor).
